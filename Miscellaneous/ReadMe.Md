05-08-25: Started working on my POE Part 1.
Brain storming the ideas of the website and making sure the colors I chose correspond with my idea was not a child's play.
12-08-25: I did my index page, also the About and Contact pages. Carefully drafting your word before coding is very crucial.
20/08/25 - I created my remaining pages whuch are Enquiry and Services, with all the requirements included.
I created another enquiry form on my enquiries page, I strongly believe there should be a form there as well.
My Services page has the services Hundzukani Group offer and it allows you to go straight to the contact us form whenever you click on the service you want to be assisted with, which is very convinient.
There was something missing about the background color, I changed it from light blue to something darker.
26-08-25: Did some final touchups ensuring that my website is perfectly functional and it does not break at any point.
I strongly advice you watch the video while fully maximized and watch it till the end.
